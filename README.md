     1)Write a program by creating an 'Employee' class having the following methods and print the final salary.
               1 - 'getInfo()' which takes the salary, number of hours of work per day of employee as parameter
               2 - 'AddSal()' which adds $10 to salary of the employee if it is less than $500.
               3 - 'AddWork()' which adds $5 to salary of employee if the number of hours of work per day is more than 6 hours.
     2)=> Create a class called 'Matrix' containing constructor that initializes the number of rows and number of columns of a new Matrix           object. The Matrix class has the following information:
                1 - number of rows of matrix
                2 - number of columns of matrix
                3 - elements of matrix in the form of 2D array
       =>The Matrix class has methods for each of the following:
                1 - get the number of rows
                2 - get the number of columns
                3 - set the elements of the matrix at given position (i,j)
                4 - adding two matrices. If the matrices are not addable, "Matrices cannot be added" will be                                                   displayed.
       =>multiplying the two matrices
